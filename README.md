# TB0.2
It's TB1 with 20% wood

BOSL2 is used for the Bezier curves. OpenSCAD files are fairly inefficient in my effort to actually complete the project. Specifically the path_bend function takes a long time to compute.

SHPE, SHPN, SHPW have deeper incuts than the original holds.

I should've extracted my functions and made a library instead but I left that for my next project.
